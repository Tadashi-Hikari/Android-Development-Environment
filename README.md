# Android-Development-Environment
This is a collection of scripts and notes so that I can develop Android apps on my device when I need to. I have been setting it up using my OnePlus 6T (running LineageOS 18.1), but am transitioning to the Surface Duo due to it's dual screen functionality. The intention is to use Emacs as an IDE for on-the-go App development. This is particularly useful to me as I am often in a place where I do not have stable access to a computer. 

### Required Apps:
* Termux
* XServer SDL
* AnLinux (Simplifies the process)
* Hackers Keyboard

### Termux/Ubuntu Setup:
* Emacs
* XFCE deskop
* Android command line tools
* Onboard Keyboard

### XServer SDL Settings:
* 720x1504 ratio (OnePlus 6T)

### Commands
* export DISPLAY=localhost:0
* xfce4-session
